If you ever heard of Where are you now,which I'm sure you have, then you probably know that skrillex helped him make this song.
Well, skrillex used to use Fl studio when he first started out. He uses ableton, but he says that he would have no
problem using Fl Studio. He said since he's a mac user he uses ableton, but he did used to use Fl Studio when he 
used windows operating system to make his first tracks.
